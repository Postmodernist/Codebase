// NOTE Always declare checked exceptions individually, and document precisely the conditions under
// which each one is thrown using the Javadoc @throws tag.

// NOTE Use the Javadoc @throws tag to document each unchecked exception that a method can throw,
// but do not use the throws keyword to include unchecked exceptions in the method declaration.

// NOTE If an exception is thrown by many methods in a class for the same reason, it is acceptable
// to document the exception in the classâ€™s documentation comment

'''
Bertrand's box paradox is a paradox of elementary probability theory, first posed by Joseph Bertrand
in his 1889 work "Calcul des probabilitÃ©s".

There are three boxes:

a box containing two gold coins,
a box containing two silver coins,
a box containing one gold coin and a silver coin.

The 'paradox' is in the probability, after choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at
random, if that happens to be a gold coin, of the next coin also being a gold coin.

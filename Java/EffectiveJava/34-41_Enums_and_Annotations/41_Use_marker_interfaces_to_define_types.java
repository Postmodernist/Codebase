// NOTE Marker interfaces define a type that is implemented by instances of the marked class;
// marker annotations do not.

// NOTE If you find yourself writing a marker annotation type whose target is ElementType.TYPE,
// take the time to figure out whether it really should be an annotation type, or whether a marker
// interface would be more appropriate.

// NOTE Strive to write good programs rather than fast ones.

// NOTE Strive to avoid design decisions that limit performance.

// NOTE Consider the performance consequences of your API design decisions.

// NOTE It is a very bad idea to warp an API to achieve good performance.

// NOTE Measure performance before and after each attempted optimization.
